    "In eQTL analysis, we test association for each gene in transcriptome against a set of variants.\n",
    "Typically, for cis-eQTL analysis, one gene could have thousands of variants to test against. \n",
    "Matrix eQTL @matrixqtl was developed to create a computationally less burdensome analysis for eQTL identification. \n",
    "Compared to other existing tools for QTL analysis, Matrix eQTL is **orders of magnitude faster** in analysis due to specific preprocessing and its use of large matrix operations for the computationally difficult aspects of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare between genes which habor different LD structures and different number of testing variants, the statistical test underlying cis-eQTL requires permutation.\n",
    "So it is computationally intensive even with matrixQTL. \n",
    "To overcome the computational burden of permutation, FastQTL @fastqtl proposed an approximate simulation scheme which is efficient for large-scale transcriptome-wide analysis, *i.e.* Geuvadis & GTEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few years, GPU has been widely adapted for many computations. \n",
    "TensorQTL @tensorqtl was recently developed which is capable of running on both CPU and GPU. \n",
    "And when GPU is enabled, it runs 100 times faster than CPU. \n",
    "Today, we will learn to use `tensorqtl` with CPU. (And to run on GPU needs only few more setup steps with the same command!)\n",
    "By the end of the lab you should be able to:\n",

    "- **Understand the types of files required for tensorQTL**  \n",
