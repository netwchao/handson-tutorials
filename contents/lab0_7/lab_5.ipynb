    "# Lab 5: Calculating the Heritability of Complex Traits with GCTA\n",
    "\n",
    "[Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Overview) (GCTA) was originally designed to estimate the heritability of complex traits using genome-wide SNPs, but has now been extended for numerous other functionalities to better understand the genetic architecture of these traits ([Yang et al., 2011](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(10)00598-7)). Generally, GCTA estimates heritability using the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), which is calculated using the genome-wide SNP data. In today's lab we will become familiar with the GCTA software and some of its capabilities, as well as explore some of the conceptual issues dealt with in class with a large SNP dataset provided by Brandon Pierce. By the end of the lab you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup an interactive job on an RCC compute node**  \n",
    "- **Construct GRMs given BED, FAM, and BIM files**  \n",
    "- **Run standard analysis in GCTA on large datasets (univariate REML)**  \n",
    "- **Run bivariate REML analysis in GCTA**\n",
    "- **Relate how increasing density of markers affects heritability estimate**\n",
    "- **Relate how subsetting markers may affect heritability estimate**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup an interactive job\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first login to RCC, you will be on the \"login node.\" While you can technically run computations with low resource requirements on this node, it is better to run jobs on a \"compute node\" (also, if you demand too much of the login node it will boot you off). Running jobs on a compute node can either be as a batch job (precode your commands in a script, submit-and-forget) or interactive (enter your commands manually in real time, while utilizing the resources of the compute node). [See the RCC Midway User Guide for more information](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run jobs on a compute node, you are using computing resources, or Service Units (SUs). We have been allocated SUs by RCC to use for this class, and you can draw from them using the \\--account command. You can also specify the number of cores, memory, block of time, and other parameters (see the Midway guide for more details). Note that your interactive session has a default \"wall time\" of 2 hours after which it will automatically end (you can adjust this using \\--time, but it won't be necessary for our labs). Also,  if the resources you requested for a job are too low, you may see something like \"bus error\" and you should increase the number of cores or RAM.\n",

    "Running GCTA is nice because it prints lots of useful information to the screen as it runs, and when it concludes. However, due to the computation required for creating a GRM, and the large size of the some of the input and output files, running it can take a bit of time. Depending on what you're doing for this lab, you can expect some processes to take up to 3 minutes, and of course, with bigger files, it would take even more time. The syntax used to run GCTA is similar to other pipelines we have used on the command line: GCTA is called and modified with option flags (see Section 2.1). For example, one of the first things you will usually need to do is take your SNP data (BED, FAM, BIM formats-just like in PLINK!) and make a GRM. **Try this with the following command and the \"test\" files:**"
